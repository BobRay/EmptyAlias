<p>Utility snippet for MODX Revolution to report and fix Resources with empty aliases</p>

<h3>Fully updated for MODX 3</h3>

<div class="box">
 <p>Honestly, there's not much use for this extra anymore, since it's now fairly difficult to create a resource with an empty alias, even in code. The only use cases I can think of are updating an older version of MODX that has empty resources with empty aliases, or accidentally removing the alias while editing a resource in PhpMyAdmin. </p>

 <p>That said, if there are resources with empty aliases, this snippet will now fix them in both MODX 2 and MODX 3.</p>
</div>



<h3>Installing EmptyAlias</h3>

<p>
Go to Extras > Installer on the main menu in the MODX Manager and click on the "Download Extras" button. That will take you to the Revolution Repository. Put EmptyAlias in the search box and press Enter. Click on the "Download" button. When the download finishes, click on the "Back to Package Manager" button. That should bring you back to your Package Management grid. Click on the "Install" button next to EmptyAlias in the grid. The EmptyAlias package should now be installed.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>To check for, and fix, empty aliases (if any), just view the EmptyAlias Resource.</p>
